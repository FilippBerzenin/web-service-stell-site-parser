Acroni is the largest slovenian steel manufacturer, which in order to produce steel recycles scrap in an electric arc furnace, casts it on 
continuous caster and rolls it into quality flat rolled steel products.
The company is specialised for the production of flat steel products and belongs among most important european suppliers of electrical 
steel. Besides non – oriented electrical steel, Acroni produces also stainless and carbon steel.
Constant development, improvement of processes and materials along with the introduction of a quality assurance system in 
accordance with ISO 9001, environmental management systems in accordance with ISO 14001 and occupational health and safety 
management systems in accordance with OHSAS 18001, are our guarantee for a constant quality level.
Our experts are always prepared to offer customers their assistance so that the excellent properties of our steels may be exploited to 
their full advantage and the satisfaction of the customer.

PRODUCTION PROCESS SILICON STEEL
SIWATT – NON ORIENTED FULLY PROCESSED ELECTRICAL STEELS
Electrical steels have special physical properties which make them suitable for application in the manufacture of electric equipments 
and appliances with rotating magnetic fields. The utilisation of fully processed steels is also widespread for construction of electrical 
static devices. Without electrical steels the production, transformation and utilisation of electrical energy would not be practical and 
would prove uneconomic.
WE PRODUCE TWO MAIN TYPES OF ELECTRICAL STEELS: 
• cold rolled-fully processed electrical steels
• cold rolled-semi processed electrical steels

INSULATION COATINGS ON FULLY PROCESSED ELECTRICAL STEELS
1) Surface insulation resistance depends on coating thickness
2) In air long time (testing for 20000 hours at a given temperature in accordance with IEC 60085)
3) In protective gas atmosphere (as stress-relief annealing)
4) It relates to the resistance to the most of lubricants, refrigerating mediums and oils. The varnish producer tests the resistance to the specific 
medium only after the customer’s requirement
5) Colour shades depend on the coating thickness and type of varnish applied

Our work is never truly done; we are a part of an endless process. This is symbolised by the three dots in our corporate logo, and the 
logos of each SIJ Group product and service brand. Three dots equals three values. Each one stands firmly on its own, and they all stand 
together, forever. As a sign of trust and quality, they symbolise our three main values, which define who and what we are.
