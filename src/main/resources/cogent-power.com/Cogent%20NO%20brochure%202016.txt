Our business
Cogent Power is a Tata Steel Enterprise. The 
specialist product range from Cogent Electrical 
Steels ranges from high permeability grain 
oriented steels for power transformers to fully 
processed silicon steels for all sizes of rotating 
machines, including thin gauge materials for 
high speed machines operating at medium to 
high frequencies. 
Electrical steels are manufactured on two sites: 
Surahammar Bruks, in Sweden produces non-
oriented fully processed electrical steels. These 
steels are iron-silicon alloys with varying silicon 
content and have similar magnetic properties 
in all directions in the plane of the sheet. 
These non oriented electrical steels are 
principally used for motors, generators, 
alternators, small transformers and a variety of 
other electromagnetic applications. Thin 
gauge materials are also available which offer 
the superior performance required for high 
frequency applications, such as hybrid car 
motors, flywheels and harmonic filters. The full 
product range is marketed worldwide direct or 
through the Tata Steel International global 
sales offices. 
Orb Electrical Steels, in the UK is responsible 
for the production and global sales of 
specialised grain oriented steels.
Cogent Power Inc., in Burlington, Ontario, is a 
world leader in the design and manufacture of 
transformer cores and components, including 
distributed gap cores, toroidal cores and flat-
stacked cores. Cogent Power Inc. also makes

Hi-Lite Thin Gauge Grades
The Hi-Lite range of advanced thin gauge electrical steels are specifically designed to improve the performance of energy efficient applications. 
Hi-Lite products reduce iron losses to a minimum at high magnetisation frequencies. This results in smaller, lighter and highly efficient solutions for 
applications such as high speed rotational motors; generators for hybrid and full electric vehicles; flywheels, aerospace and filters for high 
frequency harmonics. 
For these applications, critical aspects such as yield strength and high frequency losses are given in below table. The typical losses at P10/400 
indicate Hi-Lite grades outperform maximum guarantees given by industry standards. 
Hi-Lite products can be suplied in small quantities supporting prototype build through to full series supplies and come with Suralac 7000 or 
Suralac 9000 (bonding coating).

High Strength Electrical Steels
The magnetic characteristics of the electrical steel originate from silicon hot rolled coil feedstock which can then heat treated  and cold rolled to 
give outstanding thickness control.
Cogent recognises that new motor designs continue to ask for improved performance parameters from materials and for fast rotating machines, 
and in particular for rotors with “very narrow” load bearing parts (e.g. internal permanent magnet rotors), the strength of the material is an 
important factor.
Cogent offer a number of grades with guaranteed mechanical strength levels. In addition to our service offerings we can offer guaranteed 
mechanical properties combined with detailed fatigue and durability analyses.

Insulation coatings
Cogent Power’s electrical steels are supplied with customer specified 
coating to improve surface insulation resistance and precisely tailor  
the electrical steel to the customer’s processing requirements.
Coatings have differing properties and the thickness can be  
tailored according to requirements.
New coatings combine performance with the environment.
We ensure that our materials are produced under safe and 
environmentally friendly conditions and this duty of care is carried 
forward into application.
Our formaldehyde free and organic coating, Suralac 7000FF  
ensures a clean working environment in application, free  
from potentially hazardous fumes.
Our new bonded coating, Suralac 9000, is now available for our thin 
gauge products. This coating may be heated to enable lamination 
stacks to bond together. This type of bonding delivers improved noise 
performance for large volume production of thin materials and is 
compatible with other traditional insulation coatings.
