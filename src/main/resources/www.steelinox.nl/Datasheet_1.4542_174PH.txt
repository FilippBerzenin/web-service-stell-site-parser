General
Presentation
This stainless steel is unique in that it not only offers excellent corrosion resistance, comparable to that of type 1.4301/1.4307
(304/304L) austenitic stainless steels, but it also offers a wide range of mechanical properties once treated.
Its performance – based on its metallurgical conditions – means that it can meet demands for high levels of tensile strength as
well as being suitable for applications that require high impact strength.
It is suitable for numerous and varied applications in fields as diverse as:
• Leisure marine craft (propeller shafts, fittings);
• Food processing (handling and transfer equipment);
• Energy production (atomic power plants);
• Construction and the automotive industry.
Classification Improved machinability, precipitation hardened, martensitic stainless steel.

Corrosion
resistance
1.4542 offers excellent corrosion resistance, similar to that of type 18 Cr-8Ni austenitic steels in most corrosive environments. The
structure of this steel makes it insensitive to intergranular corrosion and highly resistant to fatiguecorrosion as well as to stress
corrosion. Furthermore, excellent resistance to corrosion-erosion should be noted due to the association of high level mechanical
properties and corrosion resistance. When assemblies of stainless steel and less noble materials (aluminium, mild steel) are applied
in atmospheric use, there is no risk of galvanic corrosion, the absence of any environmental electrolyte making it impossible for
this phenomena to develop and spread. In "critical" cases like those met in nautical applications (short term immersion of stainless
steel/aluminium assemblies, areas and dips that retain liquids), insulating the assemblies using an inert silicon seal offers good
results in terms of protection against this kind of corrosion.
1.4542 is pickled in the same way as 630 grade steel.
If necessary, the following decontamination treatment process is recommended:
One volume of 52% nitric acid (36° Baumé),
One volume water
Ambient temperature
Short duration
Wash carefully when the process is completed
The corrosion resistance of a stainless steel depends on many factors related to the composition of the corrosive atmosphere
(chloride concentration, presence or absence of oxidising agents, temperature, pH, agitation or no agitation, and so on), as well as
to the preparation of the material (surfaces free from metal particles, surface finish, such as hardening, polishing, and so on).
Precautionary measures should be taken for certain tests such as the sal
ine mist test (French standard NFX 41002): for example marking labels (that might cause corrosion run-outs and reduce the test
resistance time) should not be used on the sample.The table below illustrates a performance scale in different environments:

Hot Processing Forging
1.4542 is suitable for forging. Reheating takes place between 1150 and 1200°C, forging between 1200°C and 950°C.
Cooling in air, water or oil. The parts obtained in this way can be used:
Annealed (with an expansion treatment lasting 1 to 2 hours at 250°/300°C), or
Hardened (with optional annealing + tempering for one hour at 480°C), or
Softened (with optional annealing + tempering defined by the standards according to the desired level of mechanical 
properties).
Machinability The performance of 1.4542 in machining is enhanced as a result of the optimization of the inclusion population
Welding 1.4542 can be welded, without preheating, using MIG and TIG techniques, with or without the use of filler material, or by
laser, resistance or electron beam techniques. Welds, whether made with or without a filler material, have an annealed
structure and should preferably be subject to expansion treatment (one to two hours at 250°C/300°C) or hardening or
softening treatment (see above). For welding performed with no filler material or with a homogeneous filler material, the
welding mechanical properties obtained in this way can be identical to that of the base metal. Furthermore, it should be
restated that the welding design should make allowance for the care required with all high steels with high proof stress:
avoiding cut outs and sudden changes in cross section.
Welding with a filler material:
For MIG welding, we recommend the use of a protective gas made up of Ar+1%CO2 or 1-2%O2; gasses containing H2
and N2 should be avoided. The welding wire used as filler metal can be ER308LSi (1.4316) or a homogeneous filler called
630 (17-4PH)
Heat Treatment To ASTM A564/A564M and EN10088-3
After annealing from 1030°C to 1050°C, 1.4542 presents a soft martensitic structure with a hardness of around 35 HRC.
After annealing, if the metal is to be used in this condition, we recommend an expansion treatment lasting one to two hours
at 250/300°C, with no significant effect on its mechanical properties. This precipitation hardening steel is specific in that it
can be hardened, after annealing, using a medium temperature hardening treatment. The maximum hardness, of around 42
HRC (impact strength of 3 daJ/cm²) is obtained by tempering to around 480°C (for one hour).
Softening: by tempering at 550-760°C depending on the instructions defined by the applicable standards. To harden the
metal after this kind of softening, the metal needs to be annealed once again before performing the medium temperature
hardening treatment. The annealed bars are suitable for medium temperature hardening, performed on parts. Parts taken
from softened bars must, to harden, be subject once again to an annealing operation, then to
the medium temperature hardening treatment.
